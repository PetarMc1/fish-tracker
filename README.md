A full-stack application to track and visualize fishing statistics on the [**CosmosMC Minecraft server**](https://cosmosmc.org).

## App (Desktop Logger)

- Parses **Lunar Client logs** to detect fishing and crab catching events.
- Supports all fish types and rarities.
- Automatically encrypts catch data using **Fernet (AES 128-bit)**.
- Sends encrypted logs to the backend API in real time.
- Detailed info [here](/app/README.md)

## API (Backend)

- Built using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**.
- Securely receives encrypted data and decrypts it on the server.
- Stores catch logs per user for later retrieval.
- Includes endpoints for:
  - Fish and crab submission
  - User registration and key storage
  - Fetching logs and statistics
- Detailed info [here](/backend/README.md)

## Frontend (Viewer)

- Built with **Next.js** and **TailwindCSS**.
- Real-time visualization of fish-catching data.
- Features:
  - Sorting, filtering, and searching
  - User summaries and stats
  - Secure login/logout
- Detailed info [here](/frontend/README.md)

## Security

- Uses **Fernet encryption** for secure end-to-end data protection.
- MongoDB stores only decrypted fish data; sensitive tokens are never stored in plaintext.

| 5    | Default (no tag/unknown) | `You caught a <Fish>`, `NEW ENTRY! You caught a <Fish>` (unknown tier) | Normal catch or unknown rarity    |

Rarity is set as a number to save database space and make it easier and faster to process.
